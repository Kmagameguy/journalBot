## It Could be Sitting Right in Front of You

### Generated Content:

You're sitting on a beach, sitting outside of a house.


Is there a star there and the sky is bright orange?


I know there's no one there and yet, I know there is a bright orange star sitting very close to yours.


I know I can feel it inside of me.


No one knows I am there. But I know this star is there. And I feel it inside of me.


The universe has no boundaries. It has no time boundaries.


There is no such thing as a black hole or a spinning disc. There're millions and millions of galaxies floating in space far and wide.


There is no God. There's only us.


The universe has no boundaries. I have to move forward forward.


The Universe has no boundaries. There is no such thing as eternal life. I am being reborn.


I have only seven days to live.


The Universe has no boundaries. It's like a machine that's getting smarter. This machine is constantly adjusting, and I'm being pushed down. There is a lot more ahead, and some of the things around me are going to end. The machine is smart.


When this machine finally comes to an end, the machine will stop
