France experienced its deadliest heat wave in two decades on Thursday, leaving more than 4.3 million tourists in France without their jackets, hats, scarf or scarf and hats in high danger, local weather forecasters said.


At around 9:40 a.m., the temperature hit 116 degrees. "The maximum temperature in Seine-et-Marne is 118 Celsius," said forecaster Pierre-Laurent Morat, noting that there is an additional 10-15 degrees above normal.


People in areas where temperatures hit 106-120 degrees are urged to remain indoors or avoid heat, Met office spokesman Michel Bredow said on Friday.

More than 10 in 10 Britons are being hit by extreme hot days this summer, which is putting their health at risk, according to researchers.


Heatwave temperatures around the globe are also contributing to high numbers of people suffering from severe allergic reactions, an Asthma Foundation report claims.


Families, couples and individuals are being warned that "it's not going to be an easy summer", a spokesperson for the charity confirmed to WIRED.


An increasing number of holidaymakers have not managed to pack heat at first holiday destinations.


In the UK, travel agency Gatwick last night reported a record number of cancellations, with some visitors taking to social media yesterday to complain about waiting at the security checks after arriving in France, the latest hotspot for temperatures. Some cancelled flights, travel agents suggested, could have been planned earlier.


The worst time to visit, according to Gatwick, is "the beginning of summer when you'll probably find yourself travelling to most of Europe but in reality you'll end up staying in Europe the whole year".


France's top airlines cancelled around 50 per cent of their flights on Friday because of the country's extreme heat and record low temperatures, while flights from the UK, Spain, Portugal and Italy were also suspended.
