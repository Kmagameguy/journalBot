# 80% of the stock market is now on autopilot and the other half on autopilot

## Generated Content:

The "crowd" is going to follow, but the more the crowd, including Warren Buffett and his investors, buy the stock options on the platform the smarter the company will be. If you don't like the stock, you don't get to buy any of them.


That's why, as I write this, the company is already at around $16 billion in loss - and is likely to be down this year - from the $23 billion it lost in 2009. In comparison, Google had losses of $6.4 billion in the last quarter.


The "crowd" - the company will likely have to do anything and everything to grow and if they do, then they have no business to start after all.


It's possible that Google is a bubble, but all that's necessary for it to explode is for the market to rally to the upside because nobody actually believes all the hype.


The market should continue to rise for the next few years because it has finally been called on to stand and be counted.


What a glorious day. Let's hope it doesn't get any worse.


If any of you buy shares now, please let me know and I'll add you to the list of most buying it now.
