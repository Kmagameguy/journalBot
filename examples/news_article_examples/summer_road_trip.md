## Generated Article 1:

If you've never considered putting on weight to save that extra $25 on a new car or other purchase, we can't blame you for feeling somewhat bummed out. But the truth is we really do need to think bigger, and weigh less. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than half of Americans â€” 51 percent â€” have a body mass index (BMI) above either 25 or 30. And that number is growing, by about 10 percent annually. (Even for folks who love their cars, there's no denying they just aren't as tall as the old days, when our carmakers were able to pack in as many cubic feet into their cars as we wanted.)


The good news is that we have tools to help you out with your weight-loss plan in the form of diet programs, supplements and even exercisesâ€”all of which can boost your weight loss.


We asked the experts of the Weight Watchers website for their tips on weight loss for regular people like you.
1. Limit carbs, and you will lose


You know the drill: Add carbs to your diet and you instantly lose weight.


But if the idea of putting on muscle seems daunting to you, don't worry. The good news is you don't have to make drastic changes to your diet.

1. Put a towel over you at night to let yourself get hyped up
2. Watch an old video or read an old novel while at the park
3. Go for a run
4. Spend some time out of your car or your house (on a sunny day, of course)
5. Take a walk

Here are some others tips I've gotten while out and about. Just ask your mom or sister or your girlfriend, it's important. ðŸ™‚


Get out of your car. When I used to go out for walks every day, I would put on my headphones and listen to something soothing. Then, I would get out of the car and do things from that side of me instead â€“ go for coffee, take a walk, do yoga, dance â€“ whatever it is that I normally do to get more calm, more calm. The reason is simple, relax is more powerful than being stressed from what you're doing in your body. And more power than you have now. You can't help being on edge for more than five minutes before you calm down a bit, because you can't help being on edge. The more you calm down, the more powerful that energy and mental state becomes.


Watch your favorite tv shows. It may be on Netflix or Hulu.
