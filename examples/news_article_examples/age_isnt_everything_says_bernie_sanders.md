# Age Isn't Everything, Says Bernie Sanders. 'It Is What You Stand For'

## Generated Article #1:

Bernie Sanders' views on gender are not widely known for obvious political reasons, perhaps because women's issues rarely reach a mass scale. Nonetheless, he believes a certain part of women is entitled to special rights, and even says that women are more capable than men of performing work that's "impossible" for men. However, the Sanders campaign has done little to engage with female voters and has attempted to ignore them.


Sanders has also failed to make overtures toward women for presidential or congressional election. He's never visited a woman's hospital, and has only mentioned female leaders on a few occasions. A recent video (also available on YouTube) of him asking a woman to come meet him at a rally was seen as an attempt to bring the issue up, but the problem with the video is that Hillary Clinton's campaign did not release a statement that referenced women's issues. It was probably also to avoid any attention to Sanders' comments being racially insensitive, as he may have made a mistake by bringing up women's issues without mentioning "colored" people or a number of other groups. Bernie Sanders needs to get right with women voters.

## Generated Article #2:

In May, the Democratic candidate announced that he was running for President of the United States and he would be giving his speech later on Tuesday at 10 AM on CBS' website. So far, the candidate has posted over 800,000 "Like" on Facebook


Bernie Sanders and the rest of his team are already saying they will not be attending the rally. While there will be no big announcement, there is also no doubt that the Democrats are ready to rally behind Bernie Sanders – or any socialist and socialist candidate for that matter.


Bernie Sanders is known for his social and economic justice platform and the Democratic National Committee has been holding a number of town halls to ensure more members can attend.


It's been said that Bernie is a champion 'for the little guy' and he certainly fits the bill. However, you would be surprised if Bernie would stand in the way of Hillary Clinton's endorsement during the Democratic debate at Hofstra University after the second debate between the two candidates on Sunday.


Bernie Sanders Is a Super Powerful Man Who Never Tried to Fight For Himself. At first, not much was made of his statements during the second debate about the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It was initially made very awkward when an Asian American woman shouted that there would be a racial discrimination against African Americans coming to the country.
