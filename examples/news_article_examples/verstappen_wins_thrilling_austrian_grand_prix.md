# Verstappen Wins Thrilling Austrian Grand Prix

## Generated Content:

This time we can see our driver with a new 'car' in the drivers' room.


It's a very interesting situation as it turns out that this car was actually the one owned by an old employee of Mercedes-Benz and he was driving it around for the last few days. In the end we were able to get to see this car and even manage to get around it.


Now the car that you see is a Mercedes-Benz AMG C63 AMG, the same car that you can see driving around in this video that was filmed by a member of the public on the day of the race.


According to a Mercedes-Benz statement, the C63 AMG AMG was purchased in 2004 from a private party and has been undergoing special service and development. It had been in production for over 30 years but this is the first time it was seen in any public environment. As you might expect the AMG C63 has been given a special purpose light that uses LED backlit colours that are highly contrasty.


We couldn't make out any of the information on the driver's window, but we hope to bring you an update soon.
