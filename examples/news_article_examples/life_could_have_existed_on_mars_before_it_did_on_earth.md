"This is just one part of the incredible story of life on Mars: that of the origin and evolution of life and why we humans could not have lived on Mars before we did," said lead author Daniel Siegel of the University of Colorado, Boulder. A team led by Siegel, from the University of Washington School of Life Sciences and the University of Colorado, Boulder, has discovered a meteorite that was once a comet that crashed into the sea just 30 million years ago.


Siegel said that in light of this discovery, the age of the object itself is now estimated to be over 60 million years old, although that could just be a fluke."Mars appears as another planet in the Solar System, and when it is examined closely we may have discovered that there may have been life on Mars before it was here," Siegel said. "Our goal is simply to understand the history of life on Mars during this period of time, and to get some answers in the case of our asteroid. This will help us understand where Mars came from and why it remains in its current state.
