# The Best Performing Stock So Far This Year is a Cosmetics Company

## Generated Content:

A little history goes a long way. One of the first companies ever to go public, in 1884, was St. Bernard & Co. the largest U.S. family company to issue shares. At that time, most companies started selling stock to bond-holders like you and we for cash. This model was created because it allowed investors to control interest rates and reduce stock prices. As the economy was booming, a lot of companies were making use of this model and people kept buying stocks to avoid stock ownership limitations imposed before the collapse.


Today St. Bernard's is a private company and does no dividends. No one outside of St. Bernard's has access to its records. It is a publicly traded business called "St. Bernard's Corporation." It makes and sells cosmetics, including some dermatologists' scrubs and other products. It is a small but growing company.


But it has not been without its challenges—most notably that, despite a huge growth rate, it has had to deal with several key concerns:
1. A recession
2. Increased competition from foreign companies
3. The decreasing interest in personal care products


One of the things that stands to hurt the St. Bernard brand as much as any other is a lot of things going on lately.
