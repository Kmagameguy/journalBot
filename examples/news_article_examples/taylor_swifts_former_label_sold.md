# Taylor Swift's Former Label Big Machine is Sold, Rankling the Star.

## Generated Content:

The news was first broken by Billboard on Wednesday. Sources tell us that Swift, who has a large and lucrative international catalogue, was considering a switch to a company headed by her long-time collaborator, Jimmy Iovine.


The company will be called Def Jam Global Records, while Swift is working with Jimmy in a new venture called Def Jam Worldwide.


Big Machine, which was led before Swift by former Def Jam president Scott Jamieson, will move into the same building as the Def Jam studio that Swift and Jimmy recently owned. Swift's label and Jimmy Iovine's record label did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


Big Machine was founded in 1999 with a $100 million investment from Iovine's sister, Tiana Jardins. The company has expanded into the United Kingdom, South Africa and Europe. Its latest album, 1989, was certified Gold, selling more than 200m copies and earning Iovine the coveted Grammys. Swift is also credited with popularizing R&B and hip-hop.
