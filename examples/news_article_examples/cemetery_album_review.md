# Cemetery: Album Review

## Generated Content:

"Cemetery", is an instant success. It is dark and visceral without being considered. "Cemetery" blends the gorgeous instrumental parts with percussion from a tortured man named "Zepho". "Cemetery" is heartbreaking and graphic. The record features guest vocalists Robert Smith, Andy Morello, and Justine Suissa. What sets this album apart from the others is that it's not about mass murder. The record explores the grief and anger of a love lost. The title is taken from Cem's poem "My Life Endures" which captures the sentiments perfectly. After listening to the album I'm still trying to process how a human being can do such an amazing thing.
