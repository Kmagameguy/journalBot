# As Facebook cracks down on hate speech, it's also re-evaluating another policy: Nipples

## Generated Content:


The firm is changing its policy to forbid nipples from being used anywhere on its platform as a means of shaming users for inappropriate material — a move that critics call creepy and hypocritical. They're hoping that will put pressure on Facebook to remove material as well.


They're looking to find ways to fight the spread of nipple memes. For example, they have a list of "nipple memes, photos, illustrations, and other content associated in a fashion in which nudity has been substituted for beauty," a list that includes: "You're beautiful with a Nipple."


Another meme that some believe is problematic from a public relations perspective is of a female nipple that says "You better not have anything on your body."


Some are calling the Facebook ban "an open invitation to violence," adding that the company has had plenty of time to consider what it could do to take advantage of its platform. Facebook's new policy suggests that it's not too late.


Here's how Twitter's social media manager Jeff Smith wrote when he created the policy:


This new policy will create a new legal status for this behavior and will help prevent violence from being used against women on the Web. It will also provide companies the legal means to respond to abusive speech and harassment.
