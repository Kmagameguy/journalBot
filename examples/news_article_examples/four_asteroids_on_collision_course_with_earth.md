# Four Asteroids on COLLISION Course With Earth

## Generated Content:

Some of them are so far away we have a hard time getting close enough to see anything.


This is just a video of the last 2.5 hours before they go to Pluto, only some of them we actually got close enough to see. The second movie was after it went to Pluto and there were about a couple hundred of these, we didn't get much closer than 1000m, I think it's like 2000m. The last time this happened to some asteroids, there were about 500-1000.


The only good news: they are all about the same diameter and some very small ones.


So basically we need the right instruments to study them and that can only be done with a lot of money but it might help us to learn some interesting things.


There wasn't any data from an instrument called K2, in the last few weeks of observations, we found many observations of comets that orbit other stars like this one. The comets are very different from asteroids in appearance, and the orbits were very interesting as well. The comets were found in the same sector as the asteroid that got lost, we found comets around two other planets, both in the same sector.


We have a new spacecraft on the way that will follow around comets and then a new planet which we have started to investigate.
