## Write some fake news.

### What is JournalBot?
JournalBot is a barebones [Node](https://nodejs.org) app which creates some ML text in response to user input.  I slapped this sandbox together to play around with [DeepAI's API](https://deepai.org/apis).
&nbsp;  
### Dependencies
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org)
- [DeepAI API Key](https://deepai.org/)
&nbsp;  
### Setup
- Install Node.js
- Create an account on DeepAI's website and make note of your API Key
- Clone this repo
- Create a copy of `config.sample.json` and name it `config.json`
- Add your API Key into `config.json`
- Run `npm install`
&nbsp;  
### Running the App
- Run `npm run start`
- The app will spin up a webserver which you can access in a browser at `localhost:3000`

### Contributing
Since this is a personal sandbox, I'm not really looking for contributors.  Feel free to fork this repository for your own purposes, though!
